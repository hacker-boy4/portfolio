    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: February 17, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Ahmed Yasin built the <strong>Emix</strong> app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Ahmed Yasin and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer Data:</strong> Names, Phone Numbers, and Loan details you enter manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Records:</strong> Transaction history and payment modes (Cash/GPay).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way. The app operates as an <strong>Offline-First</strong> utility.</p>

    <h2>2. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage (READ/WRITE):</strong> Required to generate, save, and share Transaction Receipts (Images/PDFs) to your device gallery.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts (READ_CONTACTS):</strong> Optional. Used solely to help you quickly import customer details from your phone book into the app. We do not upload your contacts to any server.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Used for checking for app updates and facilitating backup features (if enabled by you via Google Drive).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>
    <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. The app uses a secure, local <strong>Room Database</strong> (SQLite) to store your financial data. No data is transmitted to external servers unless you explicitly use the "Share" or "Backup" features.</p>

    <h2>4. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites (e.g., WhatsApp for sharing receipts). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at:</p>
